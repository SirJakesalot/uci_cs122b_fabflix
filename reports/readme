<h3>How to compile the code</h3>
<p>change to the directory containing the servlet files</p>
<p>$ cd /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/project4/WEB-INF/sources/Servlets</p>
<p>run the build script that will compile all packages</p>
<p>$ ./build</p>
<h3>How to create a class file that can be compiled</h3>
<p>Add a .java file to the Servlets directory and run the build script</p>
<h3>Android App</h3>
<p>Our group made an iOS application and demo'd it to the TA already, group 14. We included the files</p>
<h3>Our Database for Project 4</h3>
<p>We are using a new database called moviedb_project4 for this project so that any changes we make won't interfere with the grading of project 3</p>
<h3>Project 4 war name</h3>
<p>We used the name fabflix_webapp instead of fabflix</p>
<h3>Project 5</h3>
<p>NOTE: When connecting to our project, you should use /fabflix/ as opposed to /fabflix</p>
<p>Master IP: 54.186.177.203</p>
<p>Slave IP: 54.186.37.7</p>
<h3>Log Parsing Script</h3>
<p>Everytime there was a request to ip/fabflix/browse, we would time how long the servlet/JDBC took to process and record them to /tmp/logs.txt. Then we would combine the results from the backend servers and run a python script (log_parser.py) to read in each line of the file and compute the TS/TJ averages. We then took these statistics and recorded them for performance testing.</p>
<p>The script can be ran like the following:</p>
<p>$ python log_parser.py /tmp/logs.txt</p>
